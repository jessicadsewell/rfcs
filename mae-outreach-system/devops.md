## Overview

Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and observability strategy for the insurance outreach platform.

## Monitoring & Tracing

### Sentry Integration

- **Purpose**: Error tracking and performance monitoring
- **Features**:
  - Real-time error alerts
  - Performance monitoring
  - Release tracking
  - User impact analysis

### Application Monitoring

- **Metrics**: Response times, throughput, error rates
- **Health Checks**: Service availability monitoring
- **Alerting**: Automated alerts for critical issues

### Infrastructure Monitoring

- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, disk, network
- **Service Health**: Database connections, external API calls
- **Scaling Triggers**: Auto-scaling based on metrics

## Logging Strategy

### Winston Logging

- **Framework**: Winston for structured logging
- **Log Levels**: error, warn, info, debug
- **Structured Format**: JSON logs for better parsing
- **Context**: Request IDs, user IDs, service names

### Log Transport

- **Papertrail**: Log aggregation and dashboard
- **Features**:
  - Centralized log storage
  - Real-time log streaming
  - Log search and filtering
  - Alerting on log patterns

## Observability Stack

### Metrics Collection

- **Application Metrics**: Custom business metrics
- **System Metrics**: Infrastructure performance
- **User Metrics**: User behavior and engagement

### Dashboards

- **Service Dashboards**: Per-service health and performance
- **Business Dashboards**: Key business metrics
- **Infrastructure Dashboards**: System resource usage

### Alerting

- **Critical Alerts**: Service down, high error rates
- **Warning Alerts**: Performance degradation, resource usage
- **Business Alerts**: Unusual user activity patterns

## Best Practices

### Logging Standards

- Include correlation IDs for request tracing
- Log all external API calls with timing
- Avoid logging sensitive information
- Use consistent log formats across services

### Monitoring Guidelines

- Set up health check endpoints
- Monitor external dependencies
- Track business-critical metrics
- Regular review of alert thresholds

### Incident Response

- Automated incident detection
- Escalation procedures
- Post-incident reviews
- Continuous improvement of monitoring
