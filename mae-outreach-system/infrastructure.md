# Infrastructure

## Overview

Infrastructure design for deployment, scaling, and continuous integration/deployment of the insurance outreach platform.

## Cloud Platform

### Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

- **Primary Choice**: GCP for cloud infrastructure
- **Services**: Compute Engine, Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage
- **Benefits**:
  - Strong TypeScript/Node.js support
  - Integrated monitoring and logging
  - Global infrastructure

### Availability Zones

- **Strategy**: Deploy based on user locations/regions
- **Multi-region**: Primary and secondary regions
- **Disaster Recovery**: Cross-region backup and failover

## Scaling Strategy

### Horizontal Scaling

- **Trigger**: Resource usage monitoring (e.g., 50% CPU threshold)
- **Method**: Auto-scaling based on metrics
- **Example**: Platform service at 50% CPU â†’ spin up additional replica

### Scaling Metrics

- **CPU Usage**: Primary scaling trigger
- **Memory Usage**: Secondary consideration
- **Request Rate**: Traffic-based scaling
- **Response Time**: Performance-based scaling

### Load Balancing

- **Application Load Balancer**: Distribute traffic across instances
- **Health Checks**: Automatic removal of unhealthy instances

## CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions

- **Source Control**: GitHub repository
- **Pipeline Stages**: Build, test, deploy

### PR Gates

- **Automated Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests
- **Code Quality**: Linting, security scanning
- **Build Verification**: Successful compilation
- **Approval Process**: Required reviews before merge

### Deployment Strategy

- **Trunk-based Development**: Main branch deployment
- **Build Images**: Containerized deployments
- **Fix/Forward**: No rollbacks, forward-fix approach
- **Blue/Green**: Zero-downtime deployments

## Infrastructure as Code

### Containerization

- **Docker**: Application containerization
- **Multi-stage Builds**: Optimized image sizes
- **Base Images**: Security-hardened base images

### Orchestration

- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration (future consideration)
- **Docker Compose**: Local development environment

## Security

### Network Security

- **VPC**: Isolated network environments
- **Firewall Rules**: Restrictive access policies
- **SSL/TLS**: Encrypted communications (TLS 1.3 for PHI)

### Access Control

- **IAM**: Role-based access control
- **Service Accounts**: Limited-privilege service access
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Multi-factor authentication, audit logging

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Infrastructure Monitoring

- **Resource Monitoring**: CPU, memory, disk usage
- **Cost Monitoring**: Budget alerts and optimization
- **Security Monitoring**: Vulnerability scanning
